{"id":"meta-agent-defs-x2j","title":"Unix philosophy composable skill primitives","description":"Design and implement a layer of small, composable skill primitives following Unix philosophy: each does one thing well, accepts structured input, produces structured output, and composes freely with other primitives.\n\n## Motivation\n\nCurrent skills (blossom, sprint, retro) are monolithic workflows — full applications. We lack the small building blocks that compose into arbitrary investigation, research, implementation, and workflow pipelines. Unix has cat|grep|sort|uniq; we need the equivalent for knowledge work.\n\n## Design Principles\n\n1. **Stateless** — no beads, no memory, pure input→output transforms\n2. **$ARGUMENTS-driven** — user input is the \"stdin\" equivalent\n3. **Structured output** — consistent format so the next skill can parse it (the \"text stream\" contract)\n4. **Small** — each SKILL.md under 40 lines\n5. **Context: inline** — fast, no fork overhead for primitives\n6. **Composable** — any primitive's output can feed another primitive's input\n\n## Pipe Format (Key Design Decision)\n\nNeed a lightweight interface contract — the equivalent of Unix text streams. Proposal: YAML blocks with standard fields that each skill knows how to read and emit:\n\n```yaml\n# Standard output envelope\ntype: findings|items|comparison|skeleton|narrative\nsource: \u003cskill-name\u003e\ninput_summary: \u003cwhat was asked\u003e\nitems:\n  - title: \"...\"\n    detail: \"...\"\n    confidence: CONFIRMED|LIKELY|POSSIBLE  # optional\n    source: \"file:line or URL\"              # optional\nsummary: \"...\"\n```\n\nSkills that produce output emit this format. Skills that consume input can parse it from prior context or from a referenced file.\n\n## Tier 1: Core Primitives (the coreutils layer)\n\n### /gather\n- Collect information on a topic into structured findings\n- The `cat` of knowledge — reads code, docs, web, and assembles\n- Input: topic/question as $ARGUMENTS\n- Output: findings[] with sources and confidence levels\n- Composes with: everything (it's the universal input generator)\n\n### /distill\n- Reduce verbose input to essential points\n- Configurable ratio (e.g., \"distill to 5 bullets\" or \"distill to 1 paragraph\")\n- Input: any structured output or raw text\n- Output: condensed items[] or summary\n- Composes with: gather output, review output, any large output\n- Unix analog: sort | uniq -c | sort -rn (extract signal from noise)\n\n### /rank\n- Score and order items by user-specified criteria\n- Input: items[] + criteria as $ARGUMENTS (e.g., \"by complexity, bundle size, DX\")\n- Output: ordered items[] with scores and reasoning\n- Composes with: gather findings, candidate approaches, any list\n\n### /diff-ideas\n- Compare two approaches side-by-side with tradeoffs\n- Input: two items/approaches as $ARGUMENTS\n- Output: comparison with dimensions, winner-per-dimension, recommendation\n- Composes with: rank output (compare top 2), design decisions\n\n### /sketch\n- Produce a minimal code skeleton (no implementation, just structure)\n- Input: approach description as $ARGUMENTS\n- Output: skeleton code blocks with TODO placeholders\n- Composes with: after gather/rank to prototype the winning approach\n\n### /verify\n- Check claims against source code, docs, or reality\n- Input: assertions/findings to verify\n- Output: items[] with verified/refuted/uncertain status\n- Composes with: gather findings, any assertion, fact-checking pipelines\n\n### /narrate\n- Turn structured data into prose for a specific audience\n- Input: structured data + audience as $ARGUMENTS (e.g., \"for new engineers\")\n- Output: narrative text (README section, PR description, ADR, etc.)\n- Composes with: any output → human-readable documentation\n\n## Tier 2: Investigation Pipes (the grep|sort|uniq layer)\n\n### /trace\n- Follow a value, call chain, or concept through the codebase\n- Unix analog: strace\n- Input: starting point (function, variable, concept) as $ARGUMENTS\n- Output: ordered chain of findings showing the flow\n- Example: \"/trace auth token from login to API call\"\n\n### /census\n- Count and categorize patterns across the codebase\n- Unix analog: wc -l, sort | uniq -c\n- Input: pattern/concept to count as $ARGUMENTS\n- Output: categorized counts with examples\n- Example: \"/census error handling patterns\" → \"try/catch: 47, .catch(): 23, Result type: 3\"\n\n### /surface\n- Find all instances of a pattern or concept across boundaries\n- Unix analog: find + grep\n- Input: pattern/concept as $ARGUMENTS\n- Output: items[] with locations, contexts, and categorizations\n- Example: \"/surface all places we validate user input\"\n\n### /sample\n- Grab N representative examples of a pattern\n- Unix analog: head -n, shuf | head\n- Input: pattern + count as $ARGUMENTS\n- Output: N items[] selected for diversity/representativeness\n- Example: \"/sample 5 error handling approaches\" → 5 diverse examples\n\n## Tier 3: Workflow Connectors (the tee|xargs|pipe layer)\n\n### /fan-out\n- Take a list of items, apply a skill to each in parallel\n- Unix analog: xargs -P\n- Input: items[] + skill to apply\n- Output: aggregated results from all parallel invocations\n- Example: \"/fan-out gather [react-query, swr, tanstack-query]\"\n- Implementation: uses Task tool to spawn parallel subagents\n\n### /gate\n- Checkpoint — present findings and ask user to approve, redirect, or abort\n- Unix analog: test -f (conditional continuation)\n- Input: current state/findings to present\n- Output: user decision (proceed/redirect/abort) + optional guidance\n- Keeps human in the loop at critical junctures\n\n### /memo\n- Capture intermediate output to a file while passing it through\n- Unix analog: tee\n- Input: structured output + file path\n- Output: same input (passthrough) + side-effect of writing file\n- Example: \"/memo findings.md\" saves current context to file\n\n### /chain\n- Compose N skills sequentially, feeding output forward\n- Unix analog: | (pipe operator)\n- Input: skill pipeline specification as $ARGUMENTS\n- Output: final skill's output\n- Example: \"/chain gather 'auth patterns' → distill → rank 'by security'\"\n- This is the META-skill that enables pipeline composition\n- May be complex to implement — could start as documentation pattern instead\n\n## Composition Examples\n\n### Deep-dive a library before adopting it\n```\n/gather \"react-query caching\" → /distill → /rank \"by complexity, bundle size, DX\"\n```\n\n### Audit a codebase pattern\n```\n/surface \"error handling\" → /census → /sample 5 → /rank \"by robustness\"\n```\n\n### Design decision\n```\n/gather \"state management options\" → /diff-ideas \"zustand vs jotai\" → /gate → /sketch\n```\n\n### Knowledge base building\n```\n/trace \"auth flow\" → /distill → /memo auth-flow.md → /narrate \"for new engineers\"\n```\n\n### Security audit\n```\n/surface \"user input\" → /fan-out verify → /rank \"by risk\" → /narrate \"for security review\"\n```\n\n### Onboarding guide generation\n```\n/census \"major modules\" → /sample 3 \"per module\" → /narrate \"architecture overview for new hires\"\n```\n\n## Implementation Strategy\n\n### Phase 1: Foundation (gather → distill → rank)\nThese three are the cat|grep|sort of knowledge work. Build them first, validate the pipe format contract, prove composition works.\n\n### Phase 2: Investigation (trace, surface, census, sample)\nCodebase-oriented primitives. These compose naturally with Phase 1.\n\n### Phase 3: Connectors (memo, gate, fan-out)\nWorkflow glue. /memo and /gate are simple. /fan-out requires Task tool integration.\n\n### Phase 4: Meta-composition (chain, narrate, diff-ideas, sketch)\nHigher-order skills that orchestrate others. /chain is the capstone — the pipe operator itself.\n\n## Open Questions\n\n1. **Pipe format**: YAML envelope vs freeform markdown vs JSON? YAML is readable but verbose. Markdown is natural but hard to parse. JSON is precise but ugly.\n2. **Context passing**: How does output from skill A reach skill B? Options: (a) stays in conversation context, (b) written to temp file and referenced, (c) explicit $ARGUMENTS quoting\n3. **Skill discovery**: How does a user know which skills compose? Need a composability reference or convention.\n4. **Error propagation**: What happens when a middle skill in a chain fails? Unix has exit codes + stderr. What's our equivalent?\n5. **Parallelism model**: /fan-out needs to spawn subagents. How does it aggregate results back into the pipe format?\n\n## Relationship to Existing Skills\n\nExisting monolithic skills would eventually be RE-COMPOSED from primitives:\n- /blossom ≈ /fan-out + /gather + /rank + /gate\n- /review ≈ /surface \"issues\" + /rank \"by severity\" + /narrate \"for PR\"\n- /consolidate ≈ /census \"beads\" + /rank \"by priority\" + /gate\n\nThis doesn't mean replacing them — the composed workflows add value. But the primitives let users build NEW workflows without writing new skills.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"epic","owner":"tyler@poorlythoughtout.com","created_at":"2026-02-13T20:50:40.352421714-08:00","created_by":"Ty Evans","updated_at":"2026-02-13T21:38:52.751239333-08:00","closed_at":"2026-02-13T21:38:52.751239333-08:00","close_reason":"All 7 child tasks complete: pipe format contract + 6 composable primitives (gather, distill, rank, diff-ideas, sketch, verify)","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"meta-agent-defs-x2j","depends_on_id":"meta-agent-defs-7h3","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-13T21:30:42.569419003-08:00","created_by":"Ty Evans"},{"issue_id":"meta-agent-defs-x2j","depends_on_id":"meta-agent-defs-8nb","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-13T21:30:42.602243535-08:00","created_by":"Ty Evans"},{"issue_id":"meta-agent-defs-x2j","depends_on_id":"meta-agent-defs-ho3","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-13T21:30:42.638023334-08:00","created_by":"Ty Evans"},{"issue_id":"meta-agent-defs-x2j","depends_on_id":"meta-agent-defs-x51","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-13T21:30:42.670002918-08:00","created_by":"Ty Evans"},{"issue_id":"meta-agent-defs-x2j","depends_on_id":"meta-agent-defs-b0s","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-13T21:30:42.702656073-08:00","created_by":"Ty Evans"},{"issue_id":"meta-agent-defs-x2j","depends_on_id":"meta-agent-defs-1on","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-13T21:30:42.733655971-08:00","created_by":"Ty Evans"},{"issue_id":"meta-agent-defs-x2j","depends_on_id":"meta-agent-defs-0xq","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-13T21:30:42.766282954-08:00","created_by":"Ty Evans"}]}

{"id":"meta-agent-defs-yiqy","title":"SPIKE: pre-computation approach — batch label commits and cache in .git/git-intel-cache/","description":"Discovery spike. Investigate a pre-computation strategy: (1) git-intel already has file-based cache in .git/git-intel-cache/. (2) Could a 'label' subcommand run the transformer batch on all commits and cache labels? (3) Then metrics/patterns read from cache instead of re-classifying. (4) What's the schema for cached labels? (5) How does this interact with --since/--until windows?","notes":"Completed. Pre-computation approach is viable. git-intel cache at .git/git-intel-cache/ already has HEAD-based invalidation. Schema: commit-labels.json mapping {oid: {label, confidence, model_version}}. Commit labels are immutable (a commit's message never changes), so cache entries never go stale. --since/--until interact cleanly: the label cache is per-commit, independent of time windows. TransformerClassifier.load() and .predict() already work for batch inference.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"tyler@poorlythoughtout.com","created_at":"2026-02-15T00:01:18.842879888-08:00","created_by":"Ty Evans","updated_at":"2026-02-15T00:03:30.392235544-08:00","closed_at":"2026-02-15T00:03:30.360103501-08:00","close_reason":"Closed"}
