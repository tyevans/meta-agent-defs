## Composition Patterns (cookbook-specific)
- Cookbook examples must be grounded in real repo content — verify patterns exist before writing examples (added: 2026-02-13, archived: 2026-02-16)
- 3 deep recipes beat 5 shallow — annotations need 120+ lines per recipe for full context (added: 2026-02-13, archived: 2026-02-16)
- Demo projects need intentional issues subtle enough to be interesting but obvious enough for primitives to find (added: 2026-02-13, archived: 2026-02-16)
