# Team Decisions

## Architecture
- File-based learnings over Memory MCP for team persistence (decided: 2026-02-13)
- Team manifests are project-local only (.claude/team.yaml), no global templates yet (decided: 2026-02-13)
- Agents are ephemeral (fresh spawn per task), learnings persist through files (decided: 2026-02-13)

## Conventions
- (none yet)
