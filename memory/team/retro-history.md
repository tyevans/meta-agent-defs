# Retrospective History

## Retro: 2026-02-13
- Tasks completed: 10 (8 implementation + 1 already-done + 1 epic)
- Commits: 14 (5 recovering prior session + 9 new)
- New learnings: 9 across 3 members (infra +3, skill-author +1 consolidated, agent-author stable)
- Pruned/archived: 2 stale skill-author gotchas consolidated into 1 RESOLVED entry
- Key insight: `env -u CLAUDECODE claude -p` enables reliable claude-in-claude dispatch; serial dispatch with sonnet subagents produced 6/6 first-try successes on install.sh tasks
- Backlog state: 75/75 closed, zero remaining

## Retro: 2026-02-13 (session 2)
- Tasks completed: 0 new (commit + push of prior session's work)
- Commits: 1 (feat: generalize team system for adoption across projects)
- New learnings: 0 (all learnings from prior session already persisted)
- Key insight: Prior session left 16 files uncommitted across 3 logical groups (global rules, beads-optional skills, templates). Committing as one coherent unit with a descriptive message was the right call -- the changes were tightly coupled.
- Backlog state: 78/80 closed, 2 open (P3 backlog items)
